loading_phrase = This song features the use of polymeter which do counterpoints between the kick drum, bass and piano's low octaves. Drums are in half time but the kick drum is doing the low bass instruments patterns which are on different time signatures. e.g., The opening section is a Polymeter between 35/16 (5/4+15/16) and 4/4 (Drum's half time) and the 5/4 is a 5vs4 Polyrhythm. You could play the entire thing in 4/4 no problem aside from the odd outro but it looks funny with big number. So enjoy :)
